# diff-as-list

Compare clojure maps. The differences come back as a list with paths to where the elements differ.

## diffl

`(diffl ...)` compares two maps or "primitives" (int, string, keyword).  It does not work with sequences.  It's origins come from the need to compare large xml files.  Clojure core's diff was not adequate because I wanted to see a list of all the differences with the path to the most primitive element difference possible.

## patch

`(patch a-map diff)` applies a diff to a map to get a new map from the applied diff

## Reason for removal of sequence comparison - version 2.x.x - 5/24/18

The original version worked with sequences, and the user had to provide a mapping of the path to the sequence, and a function to determine what the "key" of that sequence was.  I realized that if there's a way to determine a unique key in a sequence, then that sequence can be transformed into a map (and Clojure rocks at data transformation).  So, if your data structure has sequences, it is expected that they would be tranformed to a map before using `diffl`.  Perhaps in the future this should be adjusted to allow sequences of primitives.

## Usage

### Basic Example

    (diffl obj1 obj2)

## Build Notes

When bumping version be sure to change it in `project.clj` and the `(def version "x.x.x")` at the top of `core.clj`

- `$ git commit -am "commit msg"`
- `$ git push`
- `$ git tag -a vx.x.x -m "description of version"`
- `$ git push --tags`
- `$ lein deploy clojars`
- create a release from the tag in github
