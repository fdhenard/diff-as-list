# diff-as-list

Compare clojure data structures. The differences come back as a list with paths to where the elements differ.

## Usage

`(diffl ...)` compares two data structures that are alike structurally.  It's origins come from the need to compare large xml files.  Clojure core's diff was not adequate because I wanted to see a list of all the differences with the path to the most primitive element difference possible.

### Basic Example

    (diffl obj1 obj2)

A nice feature to diffl is that you can compare lists and any of their children.  To make this possible you will need to tell diffl how to find the id for elements in a list.  That way diffl will know how to find it's match in the other object's list.

### Nested list example

    (def obj1 {:k1 "val1"
               :a-list [{:k2 1
                         :oops "one"}
                        {:k2 2
                         :oops "two"}]})
    (def obj2 {:k1 "val1"
               :a-list [{:k2 1
                         :oops "one"}
                        {:k2 2
                         :oops "three"}]}) ;; <--difference will lie here

    (def list-ident-funcs
         {[:a-list] #(:k2 %)}  ;; <-- key is the path too the list and the value is the function that 
                               ;;     describes how to find the id of objects in the list

    (diffl obj1 obj2 list-ident-funcs)
